### 1. The Butter Chicken!

The [Butter Chicken](https://github.com/itsa4ankush/butterrchicken), is an first prize winner of the ElevenLabs Worldwide Hackathon in 2025 for the Amsterdam edition. The project, Anna, is a conversational voice agent developed for government and public services. This project is the recreation of the simplified version for the orignal build during the competition.
